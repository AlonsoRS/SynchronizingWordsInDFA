# SynchronizingWordsInDFA

The aim of this course project was to implement 3 algorithms to:
- Find the minimun synchronizing word for a give synchronizable DFA
- Determine if the given DFA is synchronizable 
- Find a synchronizing word for a given synchronizable DFA

To achieve this, we applied the algorithms proposed by Černý and Epstein in the papers Synchronizing Automata and the Černý Conjecture and Reset Sequences for Monotonic Automata respectively.
